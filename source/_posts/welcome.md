Pcfood.net started as an early teenage hobby project between me and a few friends, playing around with computers, web pages, gaming etc. Our first concept was to make a catalog of links to online flash games (999on(-line)). Then, we also showed off some of my first computer programs (encryption, FTP client etc).

The golden age of pcfood.net was 2005-2010, where we ran a popular Counter-Strike 1.6 web server. We also had a cool, good-looking and interactive web page, with live statistics, and ability to rent a gaming server for free. We also had an active forum, and there were many users in our community.

Around 2009, the CS server went down, and never came back online. The years after, the web pages have been kind of dead.

But now, I want to make pcfood.net great again! Now, as my personal blog, where I intend to write about topics I find interesting. To be continued....
